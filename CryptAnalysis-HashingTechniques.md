# Hash Algorithm Reverse Lookup

## ✅ MD5

- **Algorithm**: MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)
- **Digest**: `8dbdda48fb8748d6746f1965824e966a`
- **Original Text**: `simple`

MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input of any length and produces a fixed 128-bit (16-byte) output. It was developed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 as an improvement over MD4.

## ✅ SHA-1

- **Algorithm**: SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
- **Digest**: `7610bae85f2b530654cc716772f1fe653373e892`
- **Original Text**: `leonardo`

SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. It is typically rendered as a 40-digit hexadecimal number. It was widely used for integrity checks and digital signatures.
